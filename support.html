			<!-- TODO: -->         
            <p><img src="images/img2a.jpg" class="float-left">
            This in- and after-school tutorial program serves students 
            in grades Kindergarten through high school and emphasizes work 
            with children who are one or more grade levels behind, in two 
            or more subject areas. It is 
            held every Monday-Thursday (except holidays) from 3:00 p.m-6:00 
            p.m. It also serves a light snack so the kids aren't hungry 
            while working. The tutors are very helpful, enthusiastic, 
            friendly, and are willing to help you get through all your 
            homework successfully.

            <img src="images/img6a.jpg" class="float-left">
            This free program, started in 1992, aimed at empowering Marin 
            City residents to make positive changes in their lives. This 
            originally a grassroots program is the only <strong>Regional 
            Occupational Program</strong> that provides <strong>"Computer 
            Literacy"</strong> and <strong>"Business Office Technology"</strong> 
            classes in Southern Marin. It is designed to meet the 
            needs of the disadvantaged and is accessible to the handicapped. 
            The classes are offered Tuesday and Thursday from 10:00 a.m. to 
            12:00 p.m. Our Computer Learning Center is also open Monday and 
            Wednesday for lab practice. Our original goal was that all 
            Golden Gate Village residents become computer literate. Even though we 
            originally focused on local community, we welcome anybody from 
            Marin County who wants to become computer literate and acquire 
            computer skills required in a modern business environment.

			<h3>Children's Computer Classes</h3>

            <p><img src="images/img8a.jpg" class="float-right">              
            This program uses interactive computer media (including games), 
            and software-driven curriculum which minimizes the need for 
            hands-on instruction and offers 
            youth recreational and educational alternatives to drug use and 
            criminal behavior. It teaches youth about the dangers of drug 
            use and assists them in developing resistance skills; enhances 
            youth's feeling of confidency, self-esteem, identity; and 
            prepares youth to compete favorably for future educational and 
            employment opprotunities.<br>

            <strong>Discontinued in 2009</strong></a> this Landscaping 
            Contract with the Marin 
            County Housing Authority provided employment opportunities for 
            Marin City residents for many years. Partnering with Marin 
            Conservation corps, our Landscaping Services trained young men 
            to be gardeners and provided opportunities to own businesses 
            in public housing areas.
            Our workers were working diligently to care for and clean up the 
            community by performing the following duties: picking up garbage, 
            monthly hedge cutting, weekly lawn mowing and debris blowing. 
            Their quality work was keeping Marin City clean and in good 
            shape for a long time!
